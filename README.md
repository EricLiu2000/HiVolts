# HiVolts
Project by Eric Liu and Joseph Rumelhart\

Introduction: 
The Hivolts Project is an updated version of a old PLATO system video game by the same name.
It involves controlling a player as it moves around the screen, trying to avoid enemies called Mhos.
The player wins when all of the Mhos move themselves onto Fences, which are lethal for all characters.
